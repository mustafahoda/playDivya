# playDivya

I made a quick script to automate to looping through one of my favorite IG Singers. 

# Inspiration
[Divya's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/divyamsodhi/) is one of those Instagram pages I go to when I'm bored. I often found myself going through his IG when I needed good-soothing Indian Music to listen to. He doesn't have a YouTube channel so I made a script that iterates through his Instagram Account so I, and now maybe **YOU**, can also enjoy his singing.

# Takeaways
- Selenium: to automate navigating through Instagram
- BeautifulSoup: to identify HTML tags that are used to identify which buttons to click on
- moviPy: used to get the length of the video to dynamically get video length.
- requests

# Usage
```bash
pipenv install
```

This will install all the required Python Packages with one command!

Once you have installed all the required packages:
```python
python playDivya.py
```

**Enjoy the music ðŸŽ§**
