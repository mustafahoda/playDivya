# playDivya

I made a quick script to automate to looping through one of my favorite IG Singers. He unfortunately doesn't have a YouTube channel where I can listen, so this is the best we can do for now.

# Improvements
* Automate playing when the video is done playing. Currently it's set to replay after 10 seconds.
* Instagram constantly changes their class identifiers for different buttons we interace through. A more long-term approach would be really helpful so I don't have to update the code every so often.
